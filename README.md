## [Project 1: Sentiment and Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/AabhaD/Sentiment-and-Time-Series-Analysis)

* Analyzed the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine tweets to assess public opinions and acceptance.
* Recommended that showing the scientific data, information about the approvals and efficacy of the vaccine, and addressing concerns like safety, severe side effects, and allergies in ads and campaigns would **reduce public hesitancy** toward the vaccine.

## [Project 2 : Fraud Detection](https://github.com/AabhaD/Fraud-Detection)

* Analyzed the banking data and developed ML models to detect transaction patterns that signal high risk for fraud, especially for older and vulnerable adult
customers, which scammers could target.
* Achieved a maximum AUC score of **0.9694** using a **Decision Tree Classifier** which turned out to be the best model.

## [Project 3 : Spam Detection](https://github.com/AabhaD/Spam-Detection)
* Analyzed spam data and developed three pipelines using TF-IDF vectors, manual features, and combined TF-IDF vectors. The evaluation metric used was
F0.5 giving slightly more importance to precision than recall for this imbalanced dataset.
* Achieved a maximum F0.5 score of **0.9458** using an **XGBoost Classifier** which turned out to be the best model.

### Pipeline1. Data Processing + Sparse Embeddings (TF-IDF) + ML Model
Attached custom preprocessor is used.

### Pipeline2. Data Processing + Manual Features + ML Model
Manual features are extracted and used these as the input to our XGBoost Classification model.

## [Project 4 : Chicago Crime visualization](https://github.com/AabhaD/ShinyApp-visualization-for-Chicago-crime)
* The 2020 Chicago crime data was visualised through interactive dashboard in R-Shiny App.
